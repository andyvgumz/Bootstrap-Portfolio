Building a portfolio using Bootstrap tool. 

I have used Bootstrap to recreate my portfolio site with the following items:

A navigation bar

A navigation menu at the top by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to my HTML.

Included links that are applicable to my ortfolio.

Links do navigate to the appropriate sections

A hero section is included

A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and any other information I wanted to include.

A work section

A section displaying my work in grid.
